# CIS-520-FinalProject
CIS 520 Spring 2019 Final Project

## Milestone Meeting Notes (4/5):
- Look into bringing in advanced statistics
- Comparison of models, what made certain models better/worse
- Comparison of features, PCA, regression, etc.
- Bringing in additional features (salary cap information features, shoe brand, Twitter followers, etc)
- Predict given contract (# of years as well as the dollar value)
- Bring in timing variables such as the 2016 TV deal which made salaries spike and the NBA lockout
- See which current NBA players are "overvalued" and "undervalued" and by how much
- Make sure we don't have salary as a feature
- Good start.  Have to go beyond vanilla models and do comparison and further analysis to do well.
  - Normalizing salaries and other features is also good
